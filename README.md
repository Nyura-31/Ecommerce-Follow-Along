# Ecommerce-Follow-Along

Project Description

This project is a full-stack e-commerce web application built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack. The MERN stack enables developers to build seamless, JavaScript-powered applications with both frontend and backend functionality.

### **Milestone 1: Project Overview**

Overview of the MERN Stack
The MERN stack is a popular technology stack for full-stack web development. It consists of:

**MongoDB** – NoSQL database for storing application data.
**Express.js** – Backend framework for handling server logic.
**React.js** – Frontend library for building dynamic user interfaces.
**Node.js** – JavaScript runtime for executing server-side code.
This stack allows developers to use a single language, JavaScript, throughout the entire application, making development more efficient and beginner-friendly.





### **Summary for Milestone 2: Structuring and Building the Login Page**

In Milestone 2 of your E-Commerce Application project, you focused on laying the groundwork for both the frontend and backend while creating your first functional user-facing feature: the **Login Page**. This milestone introduced foundational tools, configurations, and organizational best practices essential for a scalable project.

---

### **Key Achievements:**
1. **Project Structure:**
   - Created a clean and organized folder hierarchy with separate directories for the **frontend** and **backend** to ensure modularity and maintainability.

2. **Frontend Setup:**
   - Initialized a **React** application to develop the user interface.  
   - Configured **Tailwind CSS** for modern, responsive, and utility-based styling.

3. **Backend Setup:**
   - Set up a basic **Node.js** server, providing a foundation for API integration in future milestones.

4. **Login Page Development:**
   - Designed and implemented a functional **Login Page**, combining backend validation (if applicable) and frontend responsiveness.  
   - Styled the page using **Tailwind CSS** to ensure an intuitive and visually appealing layout.

---

### **Learning Outcomes:**
- **Project Structure Best Practices:** You learned how to organize files and directories for frontend and backend development.
- **React Development Skills:** You set up a React app and built a reusable, styled component for the Login Page.
- **Node.js Familiarity:** You configured a simple Node.js server to support future backend logic.
- **Styling with Tailwind CSS:** You gained experience in using Tailwind CSS for consistent and responsive UI design.
- **GitHub Integration:** Pushed changes to a **public GitHub repository** with updates reflecting Milestone 2 progress.

---

### **Deliverables:**
1. **Folder Structure:** Separate `frontend/` and `backend/` directories in the repository.
2. **Functional Login Page:** Includes both styling and basic functionality (form submission, input validation, etc.).
3. **Updated README:** A README file summarizing Milestone 2 progress, including setup instructions and key features implemented.





### **Milestone 3 Summary: Backend Setup and Database Integration**

In Milestone 3, you focused on building the backend foundation for your e-commerce application by organizing backend code, connecting to a database, and implementing basic error handling.

Key achievements include:  
- **Backend Folder Structure:** Organized the backend into directories for **routes**, **controllers**, **models**, and **middleware**, laying the groundwork for clean, modular development.  
- **Server Setup:** Configured a **Node.js** server using **Express** to handle API requests and listen on a designated port.  
- **Database Integration:** Connected the application to **MongoDB** to enable efficient data storage and management, verifying a successful connection.  
- **Error Handling:** Added basic error-handling mechanisms to improve debugging and ensure the server runs smoothly.  

All updates were pushed to the same **GitHub repository** from previous milestones, with the README file updated to document Milestone 3 progress. This milestone established a scalable backend to support future features.





### **Milestone 4 Summary: User Model, Controller, and File Uploads**

In Milestone 4, you enhanced your backend by creating a **User Model**, managing user-related operations with a **User Controller**, and enabling file uploads using **Multer**. These additions set the stage for handling and storing user data effectively.

---

### **Key Achievements:**
- **User Model:** Designed a schema to define how user data (e.g., name, email, password) is stored in **MongoDB**. This acts as a blueprint for the database.  
- **User Controller:** Built controllers to handle user-related operations, such as adding new users and retrieving their details, ensuring smooth management of server requests and responses.  
- **File Uploads with Multer:** Configured **Multer** to enable file uploads (e.g., profile pictures) and store them in the backend, providing a mechanism to handle user-generated content.  

---

### **Deliverables:**
1. **Codebase Updates:**  
   - Added a **User Model** and **Controller** to your backend.  
   - Configured file upload functionality using **Multer**.  

2. **Repository Updates:**  
   - All progress pushed to the existing **GitHub repository** from earlier milestones.  
   - README file updated with a section summarizing Milestone 4.  

---

This milestone lays the groundwork for future user-specific features and prepares the backend to handle real-world data and media effectively.





### **Milestone 5 Summary: Sign-Up Page and Form Validation**

In Milestone 5, you focused on creating a user-friendly **Sign-Up Page** on the frontend and implementing **form validation** to ensure smooth and secure user registration.

---

### **Key Achievements:**
- **Sign-Up Page:** Built a clean and functional **Sign-Up UI** using **HTML** and **CSS**, allowing users to input details such as their name, email, and password to create an account.  
- **Form Validation:** Added validation checks to ensure users provide valid information, such as correctly formatted emails and secure passwords. This step prevents invalid data from being sent to the backend.  

---

### **Deliverables:**
1. **Codebase Updates:**  
   - A functional and visually appealing **Sign-Up Page** with validation mechanisms.  

2. **Repository Updates:**  
   - All changes pushed to the existing **GitHub repository**.  
   - README file updated with a summary of Milestone 5 progress.  

---

This milestone ensures a solid user registration flow on the frontend, preparing the application for future integration with backend functionality and user sessions.





### **Milestone 6 Summary: Backend Endpoint for Signup with Password Encryption**

In Milestone 6, you created a backend endpoint for the **Signup Page**, focusing on securely storing user data in the database by encrypting passwords.

---

### **Key Achievements:**
- **Password Encryption:**  
   - Used **bcrypt** to hash user passwords during signup.  
   - Ensured secure storage of hashed passwords in the database, preventing unauthorized access to sensitive data.  

- **Store User Data:**  
   - Saved complete user details (e.g., name, email, hashed password) in the database while ensuring security and privacy.  

---

### **Deliverables:**
1. **Codebase Updates:**  
   - Backend endpoint for **user signup** with password encryption.  
   - Database integration to store all user data securely.  

2. **Repository Updates:**  
   - Code pushed to the existing **GitHub repository** from previous milestones.  
   - README file updated with a new section summarizing Milestone 6 progress.
