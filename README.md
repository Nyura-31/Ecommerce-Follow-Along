# Ecommerce-Follow-Along

Project Description

This project is a full-stack e-commerce web application built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack. The MERN stack enables developers to build seamless, JavaScript-powered applications with both frontend and backend functionality.

Milestone 1: Project Overview

Overview of the MERN Stack
The MERN stack is a popular technology stack for full-stack web development. It consists of:

MongoDB – NoSQL database for storing application data.
Express.js – Backend framework for handling server logic.
React.js – Frontend library for building dynamic user interfaces.
Node.js – JavaScript runtime for executing server-side code.
This stack allows developers to use a single language, JavaScript, throughout the entire application, making development more efficient and beginner-friendly.

Milestone 2: Structuring and Building the Login Page

In Milestone 2 of my E-Commerce Application project, I focused on laying the groundwork for both the frontend and backend while creating my first functional user-facing feature: the Login Page. This milestone introduced foundational tools, configurations, and organizational best practices essential for a scalable project.

Key Achievements:
1.Project Structure:
Created a clean and organized folder hierarchy with separate directories for the frontend and backend to ensure modularity and maintainability.

2.Frontend Setup:
Initialized a React application to develop the user interface.

Configured Tailwind CSS for modern, responsive, and utility-based styling.

3.Backend Setup:
Set up a basic Node.js server, providing a foundation for API integration in future milestones.

4.Login Page Development:
Designed and implemented a functional Login Page, combining backend validation (if applicable) and frontend responsiveness.

Styled the page using Tailwind CSS to ensure an intuitive and visually appealing layout.

Learning Outcomes:

Project Structure Best Practices: You learned how to organize files and directories for frontend and backend development.

React Development Skills: You set up a React app and built a reusable, styled component for the Login Page.

Node.js Familiarity: You configured a simple Node.js server to support future backend logic.

Styling with Tailwind CSS: You gained experience in using Tailwind CSS for consistent and responsive UI design.

GitHub Integration: Pushed changes to a public GitHub repository with updates reflecting Milestone 2 progress.
