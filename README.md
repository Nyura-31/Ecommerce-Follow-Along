# Ecommerce-Follow-Along

Project Description

This project is a full-stack e-commerce web application built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack. The MERN stack enables developers to build seamless, JavaScript-powered applications with both frontend and backend functionality.

### **Milestone 1: Project Overview**

Overview of the MERN Stack
The MERN stack is a popular technology stack for full-stack web development. It consists of:

**MongoDB** – NoSQL database for storing application data.
**Express.js** – Backend framework for handling server logic.
**React.js** – Frontend library for building dynamic user interfaces.
**Node.js** – JavaScript runtime for executing server-side code.
This stack allows developers to use a single language, JavaScript, throughout the entire application, making development more efficient and beginner-friendly.
